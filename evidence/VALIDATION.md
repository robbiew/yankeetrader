# Trading and planet milestone validation

Validated locally on macOS arm64, 2026-10-25, with Go 1.27.3. Source and executable hashes are in `build.json`.

| Check | Result and scope |
|---|---|
| `go test -race ./...` | Pass across CLI, session, rules, and storage packages; output in `go-test.txt` |
| `go vet ./...` | Pass |
| Native build | `bin/yt`, macOS arm64 |
| Real PTY/GoDoors playthrough | Pass: Earth purchase → move → ore purchase → move → sale → quit |
| Save/reconnect | Pass: spent turns, cargo, money, and equipment preserved |
| Door32 local transport | Pass: stable record 42 keeps its ship across an alias change |
| Same-day maintenance via CLI | Two repeats preserve the exact save bytes |
| Competing processes | Three processes each commit ten increments without lost updates |
| Killed lock holder | Subsequent action acquires the kernel-released lock and commits |
| DOS trading fixtures | Five recorded ore trade outcomes match cash, cargo and treasury assertions |
| Linux amd64 build | Cross-compiles; native runtime not tested |
| Windows amd64 build | Cross-compiles; native file durability and inherited BBS socket not tested |

The terminal smoke run is fully disposable; its transcript is `local-smoke.txt`. The existing default world at `../data` is preserved; validation uses disposable worlds. No research DOS files or GoDoors library files were modified.

The two store helper tests are child-process entry points, not independent gameplay scenarios. Tests and smoke evidence establish the initial implemented loop, not full DOS gameplay parity. The generator/reference prices are provisional, and complete daily maintenance, team management, combat, NPCs and Genesis remain unimplemented. See the README's scope and storage notes before running a live BBS.

Build dependencies were available locally. Go module checksums are preserved in `go.sum`; the GoDoors source checkout was at revision `170c451faafedda81df7118012db9df129e16a7b` with pre-existing local changes. Those changes were left untouched.

Planet validation adds 19 original-DOS golden scenarios, with source snapshot hashes verified against 96 packaged evidence files. Cases cover creation, access, production, bank changes, investment and transfers. The two large-bank cases intentionally assert corrected integer debits rather than reproducing DOS rounding. Fractional production comparisons allow small DOS floating-point/time differences; this is not bit-for-bit MBF parity.

Tests additionally cover exact interest, maintenance-versus-visit ordering, clock rollback, rejected-action rollback, simultaneous bank updates, competing cargo pickup, stale access and version-1 migration. A real PTY/GoDoors playthrough creates a planet, deposits funds, invests, transfers and reloads cargo, reconnects and withdraws its bank balance. Daily planet ordering is covered by recovered-rule assertions; the 19 DOS golden cases exercise the interactive path.
